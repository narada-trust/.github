# [Narada Trust](https://narada-trust.org/)

Narada Trust is established with the sole objective of illuminating the path towards spiritual growth by transcending cultural and religious boundaries. We hope to empower individuals and communities with true essence of life, cultivating understanding, compassion, and respect for one another.

One of the main undertakings of the trust is to digitize and curate an extensive repository of easily accessible religious texts from various traditios, accompanied by insightful interpretations from renowned saints and spiritual leaders.
To that end, we have started curating the data from various [`shastras` of sanatana dharma here](https://github.com/narada-trust/sanatana-shastra-library)

Main objectives:

- Focus on purity of the text and translations.
- Curate the data in easy to process formats. With advent of LLMs and various other ML paradigms, it has become important to create high quality datasets of these texts for opening up possibilities of training models on this data later.
- Use the data to generate pdfs for easier reading of these texts.
- Maintain all the texts as open source under permissible license where contributors can continously fix and improve the data.
- Generate website version of these texts for easy linking/embedding within other documents / texts on the internet. If any webpage wants to quote any verse from these texts, it should be possible to do so easily.
- Maintain commentaries by various saints apart from the original text of the scriptures.

### Help Wanted

This is a huge huge undertaking and we want all the support we can get.

Here are some ways you can contribute:

- Help contribute the missing verses from the texts under development.
- Help proof read and fix currently available text from the ```main``` branch. You can open a PR or otherwise just reach out to me directly at ```saucam@gmail.com```
- Help with other open issues.
